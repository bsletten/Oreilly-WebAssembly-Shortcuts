# Run Basic Python in the Browser with WebAssemblyl

Amazingly you don't need anything except a relatively modern browser to follow along.

You will need the ability to serve up a local directory over HTTP. You
can do that anyway you like, but if you have Python 3 installed, it is
as easy as:

> python -m http.server <optional port>

from the directory you want to serve content from.

In this case it will be the helloworld directory.
