# Create WebAssembly Components with JavaScript and jco

You will need to install jco and componentize-js:

```console
npm install @bytecodealliance/jco
npm install @bytecodealliance/componentize-js
```

You will also need wasm-tools installed.

```console
cargo install wasm-tools
```

You will also need wasmtime installed.

That can be installed with this:

```console
curl https://wasmtime.dev/install.sh -sSf | bash
```

Or from pre-compiled releases:
