# Converting WebAssembly Modules with the WebAssemblyBinaryToolkit (WABT)

For this Shortcut, you are going to use a toolkit called the WebAssembly Binary Toolkit (WABT).

It's GitHub repository is here: https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt

The instructions for building directly from the source repository are listed there.

If you use Homebrew on either Linux or macOS, you can type:

brew install wabt

If you do not wish to install the tools, they (unsurprisingly) also run in the browser. You can copy and paste the .wat files into the appropriate place and download the .wasm file. Or you can upload a .wasm file and it should generat a .wat file you can copy and paste out (or download).

You can access some of the WABT tools online here: https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/demo/
