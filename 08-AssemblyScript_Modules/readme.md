# Generate WebAssembly Modules from AssemblyScript

There are no files in this directory other than this one.

You will need to install [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org). That will generate the remaining files that you will need to execute the code discussed.

To install, you will need a recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.

Create a new directory and enter it.

```console
> mkdir AssemblyScript-Wasm
> cd AssemblyScript-Wasm
```

Initialize a new Node.js module:

```console
> npm init
```

Now install the Assembly Script compiler for this project:

```console
> npm install --save-dev assemblyscript
```

The remainder of the steps in the Shortcut should apply to this directory now.
