# Rust Host Application for Example Components

This is a native Rust CLI application that can run components of the following
`example` world, which simply defines an add function that takes in two
parameters.

```wit
package example:component;

world example {
    export add: func(x: s32, y: s32) -> s32;
}
```

The application uses [`wasmtime`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime)
crates to generate Rust bindings, bring in WASI worlds, and executes the `add`
function of the component.

It takes in two operands and a path to a component. It passes the operands to
the component and prints the result generated by the component.

```sh
$ cargo run --release -- 1 2 add.wasm
1 + 2 = 3
```
