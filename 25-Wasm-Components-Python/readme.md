# Create WebAssembly Components with Python and componentize-py

You will need to install some Python dependencies after
creating a virtual environment as detailed in the Shortcut.

(venv) > pip install componentize-py

You will also need wasmtime installed.

That can be installed with this:

```console
curl https://wasmtime.dev/install.sh -sSf | bash
```

Or from pre-compiled releases:
