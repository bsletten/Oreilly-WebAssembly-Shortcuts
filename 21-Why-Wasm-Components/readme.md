# Use WASI to Create Reusable WebAssembly Components

In order to work with the files in this Shortcut, you will need a
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) toolchain installed. The easiest way
to manage your Rust installations is with the
[rustup](https://rustup.rs) tool. The installation instructions are
maintained there.

You will also need wasm-tools installed.

```console
cargo install wasm-tools
```

You will also need the cargo component installed.

```console
cargo install cargo-component
```
