# Use WebAssembly to Share Memory Between Host and Modules

You do not need to install anything extra for this Shortcut as long as
you have followed the instructions in the
[01-Converting_Modules](https://github.com/bsletten/Oreilly-WebAssembly-Shortcuts/tree/main/01-Converting_Modules)
directory to install the WebAssembly Binary Toolkit (WABT). You do
need to have python installed or some other way to serve up files out
of a directory. The browser will want to load the HTML, JavaScript,
and WebAssembly from the same origin.
