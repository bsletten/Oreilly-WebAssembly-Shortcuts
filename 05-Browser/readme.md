# Call WebAssembly Code from JavaScript in the Browser

You do not need to install anything extra for this Shortcut. But you
do need to have python installed or some other way to serve up files
out of a directory. The browser will want to load the HTML,
JavaScript, and WebAssembly from the same origin.
