# Use Emscripten to Do File I/O in the Browser

There are multiple ways to generate WebAssembly from C code. I want to generate some scaffolding from the Emscripten commands, so for this Shortcut you need to have the [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org) toolchain installed.

The installation instructions can be found [here](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html).

If you do not have the clang compiler installed, you may wish to do so for the first part of the Shortcut as well.

The installation/building instructions can be found [here](https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html).
